# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza: CMD
Hello world project extravaganza, the Win**dos** command line version.
## Synopsis
This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" programs written in Java; from the simplest "Hello World" batch program to a "Hello World" more complex. This is part of a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project.
 
## check out the code
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silviotorre/helloworld.git
```
## Getting Started
To run the "Hello World" program navigate to the project directory and run the program. Follow the instructions below to run the "Hello World" [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) batch program. 
Some info: A command-line batch program, commonly referred to as a batch file, is a file containing a series of commands that are executed by the Windows command prompt. Batch files have a [.bat file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) extension. Batch files are useful for running a sequence of executables automatically and are often used to automate repetitive processes as system admin tasks. Batch files can also be used to create a simple command-line interface for a program or script.

- open a command prompt or terminal
- go in the cmd directory of hello world project and then compile the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where you saved the HelloWorld.bat file.
- Run the program by typing **HelloWorld**, this is not case sensitive so you can type "helloworld", "HelloWorld" or "HeLlOwOrLd" result are the same. then the program should output Hello, World! and wait until you press a key for exit.
- Alternatively, you can run the program by double-clicking the HelloWorld.bat file. This should also output Hello, World! and wait until you press a key for exit.

```bash
HelloWorld
```

## An advanced "Hello World" command-line batch program
Windows command line character by character, you can use a loop to iterate through each character of the message and print them one by one. .

- open a command prompt or terminal
- go in the cmd directory of hello world project and then compile the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where you saved the HelloWorld.bat file.
- Run the program by typing **HelloWorld2**, this is not case sensitive so you can type "helloworld2", "HelloWorld2" or "HeLlOwOrLd2" result are the same. then the program should output Hello, World! and wait until you press a key for exit.
- Alternatively, you can run the program by double-clicking the HelloWorld2.bat file. This should also output will display each character of the message *Hello, World!* and wait until you press a key for exit.

```bash
HelloWorld2
```

## tasks
- [x] basic "Hello World" command-line batch program
- [x] Advanced "Hello World" command-line batch program char by char

# Extra Credit
- [ ] Add colours to the output
- [ ] Add typing effect to the output
- [ ] Add a command-line argument to the program to print a custom message
- [ ] Add ASCII art to the output

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute your own "Hello World" programs to this repository. Simply create a new directory with the name of the programming language and add a file named hello-world.<extension> with your implementation. Don't forget to update the README file to include your contribution!
