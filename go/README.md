# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza: Go
Hello world project extravaganza, the Go version.
## Synopsis
This repository contains a version of "Hello World" programs written in Go;

indeed this is part of a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project and you can found it in [Hello World Extravaganza website](https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/).
 
## check out the code

```
## Getting Started
To run the "Hello World" program navigate to the project directory and run the program. Follow the instructions below to run the "Hello World".
[Go programming language](https://go.dev/) is a statically-typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and built-in support for concurrency. It promotes clean code, offers fast execution, and provides powerful features like goroutines and channels for concurrent programming.

- Install Go: If you haven't already, download and install Go from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/
- Open a terminal or command prompt: Launch your terminal or command prompt application.
- Navigate to the Go directory.
- Compile the program following the example below
- After successful compilation, run the following command to execute the compiled program like in example below

```go
go build hello_world.go
./hello_world
```
