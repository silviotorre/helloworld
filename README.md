# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza
Hello world project extravaganza
## Synopsis
This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" programs written in multiple programming languages. This is a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project. Check out the project website at [https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/](https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/) for more information.

## Contributing
The first documented use of "Hello, World!" as a computer programming message dates back to 1972. It was introduced by [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), one of the pioneers of the C programming language, while he was working on the development of the Unix operating system at Bell Labs. The initial version of "Hello, World!" was used in a tutorial for the B programming language, which served as the precursor to C.

"Hello, World!" as a standard introductory example can be attributed to the growth and influence of the C programming language. As C became popular in the 1970s and 1980s, it is simple enough for beginners to understand and illustrates the basic syntax of a programming language. In addition, it is a useful sanity test to make sure that a programming language is correctly installed on a computer.

This is the original code written in C by Dennis Ritchie:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  printf("hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
```
So here is the challenge:

If you wont to contribute with your own "Hello World" programs to this repository simply create a new directory with the name of the programming language and add a file named **hello-world** with your implementation.
Don't forget to update the README file to include your contribution!
