# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza: Vb.Net
Hello world project extravaganza, the Vb.Net version.
## Synopsis
This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" command-line batch programs; from the simplest "Hello World" Vb.Net, in plain text, to a "Hello World" more complex. This is part of a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project and you can found it in [Hello World Extravaganza website](https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/).
 
## check out the code
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silviotorre/helloworld.git
```
## Getting Started
To run the "Hello World" program navigate to the project directory and run the program. Follow the instructions below to run the "Hello World" .
Some info: Vb.Net


For general more information see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vb.Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vb.Net)

- If you're using an IDE, select [HelloWorld.vb](HelloWorld.vb) and open it, click on the "Run" or "Start" button to execute the program.
- If you're using a command-line interface, open a command prompt or terminal
- go in the Vb.Net directory of hello world project.
- execute the command *vbc HelloWorld.vb* to compile the program.
- Then execute the generated executable by running HelloWorld.exe. You need .net framework installed on your machine to do so.


```commandline

vbc HelloWorld.vb

```
## the .net framework
The .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.

- To download the .net framework go to [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- To check if the .net framework is installed on your machine, open a command prompt or terminal and execute the command *dotnet --version*.
- To check if vb.net is installed on your machine, open a command prompt or terminal and execute the command *vbc --version*.
- To update the .net framework, download the latest version and install it.
- info about the .net framework can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework)

## An advanced version of Vb.Net "Hello World" program

- If you're using an IDE, select [ComplexHelloWorld.vb](ComplexHelloWorld.vb) and open it, click on the "Run" or "Start" button to execute the program.
- If you're using a command-line interface, open a command prompt or terminal
- go in the Vb.Net directory of hello world project.
- execute the command *vbc ComplexHelloWorld.vb* to compile the program.
- Then execute the generated executable by running ComplexHelloWorld.exe. You need .net framework installed on your machine to do so.
  
```commandline

vbc ComplexHelloWorld.vb

```

## tasks
- [x]  basic "Hello World" Vb.Net
- [x]  Advanced "Hello World" Vb.Net 

# Extra Credit
- [ ]  Create a "Hello" class library with the Vb.Net function
- [ ]  Add advanced features to the Vb.Net function
- [ ]  Add unit test to the Vb.Net function

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute your own "Hello World" programs to this repository. Simply create a new directory with the name of the programming language and add a file named hello-world.<extension> with your implementation. Don't forget to update the README file to include your contribution!
