# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza: Python
Hello world project extravaganza, the Python version.
## Synopsis
This repository contains a collection of "Hello World" command-line batch programs; from the simplest "Hello World" Python, in plain text, to a "Hello World" more complex. This is part of a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project and you can found it in [Hello World Extravaganza website](https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/).
 
## check out the code
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silviotorre/helloworld.git
```
## Getting Started
To run the "Hello World" program navigate to the project directory and run the program. Follow the instructions below to run the "Hello World" .
Some info: Python


For general more information see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python)

- open a command prompt or terminal
- go in the Python directory of hello world project.
- you can run the project web page in windows you can run the [hello-world.html](hello-world.html) file with start command (see example below)
- you can run the project web page in linux you can run the [hello-world.html](hello-world.html) file with xdg-open command

alternatively you can:
- Open the [hello-world.html](hello-world.html) file with your browser.
- Or you can open the [hello-world.js](hello-world.js) file with your favorite editor and run it

## Example
```commandline

start hello-world.html

```
## An advanced version of Python "Hello World" program
There is several design patterns and you could potentially use it together, even though they would typically be used in much more complex and specific scenarios. In this example we use the module pattern, the module pattern is a common Python coding pattern. It’s generally well understood, but there are a number of advanced uses that have not gotten a lot of attention. Also we use Observer and Factory design patterns. 
The Observer pattern offers a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs. This pattern is the cornerstone of event driven programming, including Python. The Observer pattern facilitates good object-oriented design and promotes loose coupling. Objects don’t have to know a lot about each other to interact, but instead need only be concerned with the fact that the event they are subscribing to will trigger if applicable. This pattern is also key in the effective use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. 
The Factory pattern is another creational pattern concerned with the notion of creating objects. Where it differs from the other patterns in its category is that it doesn’t explicitly require us to use a constructor. 
Instead, a Factory can provide a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory object we wish to be created.

- Open [hello-world2.html](hello-world2.html) file in a web browser.
- Open the Python Console. This is typically done by right-clicking on the web page, selecting "Inspect", and then going to the "Console" tab. You may also use F12 key or Ctrl+Shift+J (or Cmd+Option+J on Mac).
- You should see the output of the Python code in the console.


## tasks
- [x]  basic "Hello World" Python and html file
- [x]  Advanced "Hello World" Python and html file
- [ ]  linked "Hello World" Json files with parameters

# Extra Credit
- [ ]  Add external css file to the html file
- [ ]  Add advanced features to the Python function getHelloWorld()
- [x]  Add unit test to the Python function

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute your own "Hello World" programs to this repository. Simply create a new directory with the name of the programming language and add a file named hello-world.<extension> with your implementation. Don't forget to update the README file to include your contribution!
