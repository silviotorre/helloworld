# Hello World in Multiple Languages Extravaganza: Perl
Hello world project extravaganza, the Perl version.
## Synopsis
This repository contains a version of "Hello World" programs written in Perl;

indeed this is part of a fun and educational project that showcases how to print "Hello World" in different programming languages. The goal is to have a "Hello World" program in every programming language. This project is inspired by the [GitHub Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) project and you can found it in [Hello World Extravaganza website](https://silviotorre.github.io/helloworld/).
 
## check out the code
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silviotorre/helloworld.git
```
## Getting Started
To run the "Hello World" program navigate to the project directory and run the program. Follow the instructions below to run the "Hello World".


- If you're on a Unix-like system, Perl is likely already installed. If you're on Windows, you can download Perl from [ActiveState](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/).
- Open a terminal or command prompt: Launch your terminal or command prompt application.
- Navigate to the Perl directory.
- Compile the program following the example below
- After successful compilation, run the following command to execute the compiled program like in example below

```perl
perl hello_world.pl 
```
Here's an example of a more complex "Hello, World!" program in Perl. This one use regular expression and substitution operator 's///' and the flexibility of Perl to print the string in different ways. Checkout the code in the file hello_world2.pl and try to use say instead of print to see the difference.
    
    ```perl
    Perl build hello_world2.pl
    ```


## tasks
- [x]  basic "Hello World"  Perl program
- [x]  Advanced "Hello World" Perl program

# Extra Credit
- [x] Add a flexibile example to the program
- [ ] Add a test to the program

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute your own "Hello World" programs to this repository. Simply create a new directory with the name of the programming language and add a file named hello-world.<extension> with your implementation. Don't forget to update the README file to include your contribution!
