-- This is a comment. Comments start with '--' in SQL.

-- Print "Hello, World!" to the console
SELECT 'Hello, World!';
-- SELECT is a command that tells the database to return data to the user.
-- 'Hello, World!' is a string literal. String literals are enclosed in single quotes.
-- ; is a statement terminator. It tells the database that the statement is complete.
-- SELECT statements always return a table. This SELECT statement returns a table with one row and one column.
-- The column name is "Hello, World!".
-- The column type is "text". Text is a string of characters.
-- The value is "Hello, World!".
-- The database prints the table to the console. As example in mySQL, the console is the terminal window and the table is printed in a grid.
-- So if you want to print "Hello, World!" mysql, you can use the following command:
-- mysql -u root -p < helloworld.sql
-- Easy, right?
